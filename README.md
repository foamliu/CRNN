# Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network

## Introduction

This is a PyTorch re-implementation of CRNN: Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05717.pdf)). The features are summarized blow:


## DataSet

We use the synthetic dataset ([Synth](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/)) released by Jaderberg et al. as the training data. The dataset contains 8 millions training images and their corresponding ground truth words.
Such images are generated by a synthetic text engine and are highly realistic.

## Dependency

- PyTorch 1.1.0

## Usage
### Data Pre-processing
Extract training & test images:
```bash
$ python extract.py
```

### Train
```bash
$ python train.py
```

If you want to visualize during training, run in your terminal:
```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir runs
```

### Demo
Pick 10 random test examples from ICDAR-2015:
```bash
$ python demo.py
```
